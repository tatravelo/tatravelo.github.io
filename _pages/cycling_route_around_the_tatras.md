## Cycling Route Around The Tatras

Cycling Route around the Tatras is a public project that aims to build a 250 km cycleway loop around the Tatras. It’s complete in some stages while completely unstarted in others which doesn’t make it a good option for now (with some very busy main road sections). It’s a vital project on the Polish side where there weren’t many cycleways, so basically the project means a construction of completely new roads here while in Slovakia it will be one of many already existing routes.

TatraVelo classic route uses SwT (Szlak Wokół Tatr in Polish) in many sections - where it is reliable. Our xtra loops complement the attractions checklist taking you to many places that the future Cycling Route around the Tatras is going to include.

You can check the details on the official SwT website.
TatraVelo, as a private initiative, is a partner and is in a constant cooperation with Szlak Wokół Tatr.
